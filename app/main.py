"""
The KNIGHTS constant has been moved to a separate module with the
possibility of further expansion.
A preparation package has been created with modules related to battle
preparation moved there.
@staticmethod is used in classes to calculate changed characteristics.
* In main.py, 2 separate list comprehensions are used at the beginning of
the function to ensure that tests work correctly.
